# React & Tailwind Landing Page

This is my solution to [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef/hub) Sunnyside agency landing page challenge. I wanted to get started with using Tailwind that's why I chose this CSS framework for the styling.

## The Challenge ðŸ’ª

This challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible. It focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle.

## Reflection ðŸ’­

This is my first project built using tailwind and it's so much fun!! Tailwind makes everything faster and easier, I finished this landing page in a span of 2 mornings. I now understand the basic of tailwind and I can't wait to continue using it.
