# React & Tailwind Landing Page

This is my solution to [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) Sunnyside agency landing page challenge. I wanted to get started with using Tailwind that's why I chose this CSS framework for the styling.

### The Challenge

This challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
